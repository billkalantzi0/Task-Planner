This is a Python code that implements a ToDo application using Flet. 
The application allows users to create and manage their tasks. 
The tasks are stored in a JSON file named "tasks.json".

The application consists of two classes - Task and TodoApp, both of which are derived from the Flet UserControl class.

The Task class represents a single task in the application. 
It contains a Checkbox control to display the task name and its completion status. 
It also has an edit button and a delete button to allow users to edit and delete tasks. 
The class has methods to handle events associated with these controls.

The TodoApp class represents the main application. 
It contains a Column control to display a list of tasks, a TextField control to allow users to add new tasks, 
and a Tabs control to allow users to filter tasks by completion status. 
he class also contains controls to display the number of incomplete tasks and to clear completed tasks. 
The class has methods to handle events associated with these controls.

The application reads the tasks from the "tasks.json" file and populates the task list when it starts. 
The application saves the task list to the "tasks.json" file when the user clicks the Save button.

Known error after 1.0.1 
The code used to call the tasks.json file assumes you are cd'd in the py/app/script.py folder.
This means that There has to be a better way of ensuring the json file isnt lost when converting it into an exe, or 
even when you python /py/app/script.py, as this does not mean you have cd'd into the folder meaning it cannot call the 
json file as you \\..\\ into a completly different folder. potential fix is to just keep the json in the same folder 
as the python script.
