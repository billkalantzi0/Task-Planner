//Description: with intentions of making this json file EASILY dynamic (given my lack of programming knowledge) i have decided to give each task a ...
//.. "label" that i will later use to organise the tasks automatically. i did NOT opt for a folder structure as this might prove cumbersome when programming...
//.. and i dont want there to be any sub categories. I only to answer to 1 question "what is the next task i must do?" there needs not be any special categories.. 
//.. so instead of a pile of folders, just a stack of single sheets. This way i might not need to go in an out of "folders" and have multiple parallel tasks, ..
//.. separated into different folders. i could be wrong, so this might change in V2
